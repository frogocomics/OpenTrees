# OpenTrees
This is a project dedicated to adding as much trees as possible for Minecraft builders and terraformers. We aim to make trees as realistic as possible and also as good looking as possible. We hope that this project someday become the biggest collection of trees there is, and the GOTO place for many, many aspiring terraformers. **With your help and contribution, this can be acheived!** 
#Contribution
We would greatly appreciate all contributors and all contributors will be fully credited and linked. We, however have some guidelines.
- This collection of trees should be as realistic as possible. This means no fantasy based trees will be accepted. We would prefer it if trees were refered off a photo.
- Trees are named like this: (Scientic Name) (Size)(Varient).schematic _Example: Homo Sapians L2_
- Schematics should be as optimized as possible: we would prefer if it is trimmed along the edges to remove useless air.
- One variation of a tree is not good enough. We should like it if you include **at least** four variations, and at least 2 sizes.
This is accepted:
Medium Variation 1
Medium Variation 2
Large Variation 1
Large Variation 2

This is not accepted:
Small Variation 1
Small Variation 2
Small Variation 3
Small Variation 4
